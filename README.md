# spring-boot-masterclass-project
These are my code along files related to the springboot master class project from amigoscode.com

Went to this website, https://start.spring.io/ and bootstrapped our project with these settings: https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.3&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.balun&artifactId=spring-boot-mc&name=spring-boot-mc&description=Project%20for%20the%20spring%20boot%20master%20class&packageName=com.balun.spring-boot-mc&dependencies=web

NOTE: He uses java 15 and springboot 3.4.2 but both of those are obsolete and the time of me taking the course.  I am using Java 17 and springboot 3.0.3
